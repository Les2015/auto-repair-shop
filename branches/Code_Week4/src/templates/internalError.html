			<p><strong>We are sorry to report that some type of error internal to this software
				has occurred.  We would suggest that first, you simply hit the Back button
				on your browser and retry the action that you requested.  If the same problem
				occurs again, then there is either a problem with the server that will clear
				up in the near future, or we missed a problem in the program.
			</strong></p>
			<p><strong>If this problem does not clear up after retrying one or two times and if the
			   information below suggests this is something other than a temporary problem
			   (we know, we know, it's all gibberish) please print this page and contact
			   QuickSoft's support hotline: 1-800-WEGOOFED.
